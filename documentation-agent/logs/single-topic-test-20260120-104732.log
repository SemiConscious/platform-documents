[planner] 💭 Thinking:
Based on my analysis of the STATUS.md, BACKLOG.md, and repository inventory, I can now identify the highest priority remaining item. Looking at the backlog:

**Priority 3: Salesforce Integration** - Has overview complete but deep-dives are outstanding:
- AVS package deep-dive
- SCV BYOT connector details  
- Omni-Channel integration details
- Voice Call object usage

**Priority 4: AI/CAI** - Has overview complete but deep-dives are outstanding:
- Bedrock integration deep-dive
- Prompt pipeline documentation  
- WebSocket service details

**Priority 5: Terraform Module deep-dives** - Listed in parking lot

Looking at the backlog structure, **Salesforce Integration deep-dive** is the highest priority incomplete item (Priority 3 vs Priority 4/5 for others) that is not marked as deferred or complex.
